[Language] - A stack-based language based on partial application
====

(I don't have a name for it yet.)

There are versions of the language made before I made this repo, I may put them up.

The language right now is mostly unstable and, while working, doesn't have much on it.  The language is both written in and compiles to Racket.  Whether or not I will write the compiler in another language is a possibility, but I will definitely change the language it targets, possibly to C.  Right now, the language is interpreted on a REPL.  Once I add a few more things to the language, I will start making the actual compiler.  Right now, the REPL will print the correct Racket statement for everything you type.
